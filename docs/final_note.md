# A Final Note

As a final note, I would like to stress the importance of the instructional video provided for learning how to use PBR Painter effectively.
In addition to this, I will also be adding more demo-type videos over time, showing how to use PBR Painter for specific applications. After all,
there is only so much that written documentation can do. I think you will find that an hour or so spent watching these videos is well worth it.

And finally, if you have purchased PBR Painter - I sincerely thank you for your support. A lot of effort has gone into making PBR Painter as
powerful and user-friendly as possible, and I will continue to put in effort to maintain the addon and continuously improve it. Having your
support makes this all the more possible and enjoyable. 

I would love to see what you do with PBR Painter, so please feel free to share anything you have created with me at w2gardner@gmail.com. I will
be genuinely excited to see what you can do with it!

I also welcome any feedback and/or suggestions for future versions, so please share these with me as well.

Thanks, and happy Blendering!
