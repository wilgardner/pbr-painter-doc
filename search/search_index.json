This can be installed in Blender using the normal approach: Finding PBR Painter in Blender PBR Painter is located in Texture Paint mode at the bottom of the Tools panel: Preparing for Painting PBR Painter combines Blender's built in texture painting toolset with complex node setups (behind the scenes) to enable layered, multipass PBR painting. As such, preparing a mesh for PBR Painting is identical to the steps involved in preparing for traditional texture painting. In other words, the mesh must first be UV unwrapped using whichever method you prefer. Then, a new material needs to be added, which can be done within PBR Painter's UI. Once this is done, you are ready to start adding PBR Layers and painting your PBR texture! Important Considerations (PLEASE READ) There are a few things to consider before getting started as these will have a considerable impact on your experience with PBR Painter: PBR Painter generates complex node groups associated with each layer. These are created, modified, connected and deleted using the various tools within the addon, so you never actually need to even look at the node tree. It is important to NOT delete any of the node groups created by PBR Painter as this could cause issues with the addon, and may break the addon entirely . If you feel that there should be more flexibility with regards to how PBR Painter could be incorporated with a manual node setup, please send me an email (w2gardner@gmail.com) and I will try to incorporate your suggestions into future versions of the addon. As is discussed in the following sections, there is a button within the PBR Painter UI called Save Images , which automatically saves all modified images. It is important that images are regularly saved , to avoid losing any work due to unexpected crashes etc. There is a limit on the number of image texture nodes that can be represented using Eevee within the Material Preview mode. If you reach this limit (somewhere between 30-40) by adding many PBR layers, your texture will turn solid pink. If this happens, there are two potential options going forward: Option one is to hide one or more lower layers while you work on new layers. Option two is to take advantage of the Merge Visible tool in the PBR Painter UI (discussed more in the following sections), which will merge all of the currently visible active layers into a single layer, which uses corresponding merged image textures.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started.html#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started.html#installation","text":"When you purchase PBR Painter, you will have access to the .zip file that contains the entire addon package.

The new merged layer will replace all of the visible layers and will be locked at the bottom of the layer list. It is therefore advised that you only use this tool when you are entirely happy with the layers being merged and you won't need to make any changes later on. When you select merge visible, you will see the following popup: Essentially, merge visible is a smart baking tool that automatically detects which PBR components (albedo, roughness, normals etc) need to be baked in order to reproduce the material exactly. In other words, the algorithm will detect which components to the texture vary between layers, and therefore require a map. All other components will simply be given the constant value associated with the material. Because the merged layer cannot be modified, it is advised that you select Backup Material (on by default) when merging, as this will backup the current material in case you need to change anything later. Note that this backed up material will dissapear when restarting Blender, however the individual layers will also be stored in the Deleted Layers panel, if you need to access them that way. As per the image above, you can specify the resolution of the baked textures. This is 4k by default, but you may need to increase this if you have high resolution starting textures and/or you use a high scale value in the mapping. If the resolution is too low, you may lose detail/quality in the merged layer, so you can repeat the process with a higher resolution (assuming you have backed up the material). As a final note, you will be prompted to open the system console prior to clicking ok . This will let you monitor the progress of the layer merging/baking. Otherwise, Blender will merely freeze until the algorithm is completed.","title":"Merge Visible"},{"location":"merge_visible.html#merge-visible","text":"The merge visible tool, located in the main UI panel, creates a merged layer using all of the visible (i.e. not hidden) layers in the PBR layers list.

Ticking a checkbox will allow you to import your map from its directory: Once a map is imported, you have access to all of the various properties associated with a normal image texture node. Note that you will need to change the color space to non-color if necessary (e.g. for roughness, normals etc.): Once you are happy with your imported maps and/or values for other PBR components, this panel can be closed to clean up the UI. Now, you are ready to check out the Texture Mapping panel. Texture Mapping This panel allows you to change the scale , location (in the x and y directions) and the rotation of any imported PBR texture maps: Note that if no maps are imported you will be prompted that this panel is not applicable. Play around with these values to get the mapping that works for you, then you are ready to check out the panel you will probably use most often: the Layer Settings panel. Layer Settings You will probably spend most of your time within this panel while you are fine-tuning your texture. Here is where you will find the most powerful tools that will let you create ultra realistic textures that can be tuned to look just right. This is what the panel looks like: Firstly, you can access the opacities of each of the PBR components you specified earlier in Texture Maps . Note that this is the opacity of this layer with respect to the other layers beneath it. Therefore, these sliders are extremely powerful for letting you merge each component individually with those of the underlying layers. You will also notice a Combine Normals checkbox. As the name suggests, this lets you combine the normals of the current layer with those underneath, using a mathematically-derived approach that is much more accurate and produces far better results than merely setting the normal opacity to 0.5. Because of this, you can stack normals from multiple layers and combine them all into a single normal map for your texture, which will retain all of the details associated with each layer's normal map in the final map. Finally, you can also set the Height Scale , Height Midlevel and the AO Strength here, which are only applicable if you use a non-zero height (or a height map) or an AO map for the layer, respectively. As an example, the following settings were used (in the moss layer) to generate this moss-covered rock texture: And the following settings were used in the logo layer to add a 3D logo (using an alpha mask) on top: As you can see, the Layer Settings panel enables essentially limitless possibilities for combining layers and generating interesting and realistic effects, so I encourage you to play around with all of the tools provided to see what works for your texture. Other Principled BSDF Inputs Here you will find all of the other inputs to the Principled Shader, which can be modified as necessary. Note that you can also change the opacities of each input for the layer, as per the previous section. In many cases, these values can remain unchanged, however there are certain materials that will require them to be modified. Note that any modified values will trigger the Merge Visible button to bake that value as an individual map, as is explained later. Deleted Layers Finally, the last panel, the Deleted Layers lets you recover up to 10 deleted layers and return them to the active layers list. This is useful if you change your mind or accidentally delete a layer and wish to recover it at a later point. Alternatively, layers can be permanently deleted from this panel, at which point they can no longer be recovered.","title":"Other UI Panels"},{"location":"other_panels.html#other-ui-panels","text":"","title":"Other UI Panels"},{"location":"other_panels.html#texture-maps","text":"Here you can import any combination of PBR texture flat maps, including albedo/base color , metallic , roughness , normals , height , alpha and/or ambient occlusion (AO) : Alternatively, or in combination with these maps, you can also select a single value for the base color , metallic , roughness and/or height .
