If you select multipass (which you will use most frequently), you need to select the resolution and of the new layer. This is the resolution of the mask you will be painting that will be used to perform the multipass PBR painting. You can also opt for 32 bit floating point depth, as opposed to 16 bit by default. If you select single pass , nothing else needs to be specified, as you will specify these values separately for each PBR channel that you paint. The following sections explain how the multipass and single pass layer types work, and how they differ from eachother. This will also become clearer as you read through the remaining documentation. Multipass Layers As mentioned, multipass layers provide almost all of the functionality of PBR Painter. With a multipass layer, you can paint any combination of PBR Channels - either using single values, imported texture maps and/or procedural textures - simultaneously onto your mesh, with a single brush stroke. For multipass layers, you will be painting a single mask that will be used to generate all of the PBR channels you have selected. This process is what enables the multipass painting functionality. For example, you could simultaenously paint using an imported albedo texture, a constant roughness value of, for example, 0.2, and a procedural normal/bump texture. You can also opt to specify any other input to the Principled Shader to be included within the multipass setup. Again, this will become clearer later. Single Pass Layers For a single pass layer, you can paint any combination of albedo , metallic , roughness , normal , bump or height textures directly. The important distinction here is that the single pass layer lets you paint these PBR channels separately within a single layer, meaning that they can occupy different areas on the mesh, and they can be non-uniform values (e.g. you can paint variations in roughness directly, whereas for multipass layers the roughness is either a single value or a texture). These layers are therefore essentially the same as the internal texture paint system in Blender, although they have been adapted to be able to be included in PBR Painter's layered setup. One important application of single pass layers is painting over texture seams, which is demonstrated in the instructional video provided. The UI with Layers Once you've added one or more layers, you will see the complete UI for the addon. This is outlined below: The following can be accessed in this main panel: Active material : The active material for the selected object. List of active layers : Shows all of the active PBR layers associated with the material, in order. That is, layers higher up on the list appear on top in the material. Layer type : The type of layer, either multipass , single pass or merged (more on this later). Layer name : The (modifiable) name of the currently selected layer, shown in the list. Paint/erase : Switch between painting and erasing the currently selected layer. Hide layer : Hide the currently selected layer. New layer : Add a new layer to the list. Note that the new layer will be added immediately above the currently selected layer. Delete layer : Delete the currently selected layer. Note that up to 10 layers are stored in the Deleted Layers panel (more on this later). Move layer : Move the currently selected layer up or down in the list. Duplicate later : Duplicate the currently selected layer. Merge visible : Merge all visible layers (more on this later). Toggle texture autosaving : Turn on/off autosaving of modified textures. Bake visible : Bake the visible material to textures (more on this later). Save images : Saves all modified masks to the .blend file. This is important to avoid any loss of work due to unexpected crashes etc. In addition to these tools, there are also 6 subpanels which constitute the remainder of the addon: PBR Channels , ID Map , Masks , Texture Mapping , Other Principled BSDF Inputs , and Deleted Layers . The following sections in this documentation describe what is in these subpanels and their various functionalities/purposes.

Wil","title":"A Final Note"},{"location":"getting_started.html","text":"Getting Started Installation When you purchase PBR Painter, you will have access to the .zip file that contains the entire addon package. This can be installed in Blender using the normal approach: Updating to New Versions If you already have an old version of PBR Painter installed, and wish to update to a new version, please follow the following steps: 1. Completely uninstall the old version from Blender. 2. Close and restart Blender to ensure any cached files are cleared. 3. Install the new version as per normal. Finding PBR Painter in Blender PBR Painter is located in Texture Paint mode at the bottom of the Tools panel: Preparing for Painting PBR Painter combines Blender's built in texture painting toolset with complex node setups (behind the scenes) to enable layered, multipass PBR painting. As such, preparing a mesh for PBR Painting is identical to the steps involved in preparing for traditional texture painting. In other words, the mesh must first be UV unwrapped using whichever method you prefer. Then, a new material needs to be added, which can be done within PBR Painter's UI. Once this is done, you are ready to start adding PBR Layers and painting your PBR texture! Important Considerations (PLEASE READ) There are a few things to consider before getting started as these will have a considerable impact on your experience with PBR Painter: PBR Painter generates complex node groups associated with each layer. These are created, modified, connected and deleted using the various tools within the addon, so you never actually need to even look at the node tree. It is important to NOT delete any of the node groups created by PBR Painter as this could cause issues with the addon. Deleting nodes within a node group may break the addon entirely. As is discussed in the following sections, there is a button within the PBR Painter UI called Save Images , which automatically saves all modified images. It is important that images are regularly saved , to avoid losing any work due to unexpected crashes etc. Alternatively, with the release of v1.1 you can now opt to automatically save all modified images periodically by checking the Autosave Textures box. There is a limit on the number of image texture nodes that can be represented using Eevee (and also for Cycles , but it is much higher). If you reach this limit by adding many PBR layers, your material will turn solid pink. If this happens, there are two potential options going forward: Option one is to hide one or more lower layers while you work on new layers. Option two is to take advantage of the Merge Visible tool (discussed more in the following sections), which will merge all of the currently visible active layers into a single layer. With v1.1, you now have access to procedural textures for each PBR Channel. These provide exciting new possibilities for creating new materials from scratch, but be aware that adding lots and lots of these to the same material, and/or adding many layers, can cause some lag. Unfortunately, this is unavoidable and is just related to how Blender deals with these procedural texture nodes. If you add so many layers that the lag becomes unbearable (you shouldn't get to this point in most situations), you can use the Merge Visible button to combine all of the complex layers to a single merged layer, then you can continue working from there. As a final note: You are encouraged to try out v2.0, which is currently in the beta stage of development. This version has loads of awesome new features and has been completely overhauled for a huge boost to performance, but given it is still in the beta stage, it may contain some bugs. If you experience any bugs, please report these directly via email at w2gardner@gmail.com, or reach out via Twitter (@PBRPainter).","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started.html#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started.html#installation","text":"When you purchase PBR Painter, you will have access to the .zip file that contains the entire addon package.

Both use the same algorithm, which automatically detects which PBR channels (albedo, roughness, normals etc) need to be baked in order to reproduce the material exactly. In other words, the algorithm will detect which channels vary between layers, and therefore require a baked texture. All other channels will simply be given the constant value associated with the material. The difference between merge visible and bake visible is that merge visible creates a merged layer using all of the visible (i.e. not hidden) layers in the PBR layers list, in addition to baking the textures. Once layers are merged, the merged layer will replace all of the visible layers and will be locked at the bottom of the layer list. It is therefore advised that you only use this tool when you are entirely happy with the layers being merged and you won't need to make any changes later on. When you select merge visible , you will see the following popup: Because the merged layer cannot be modified, it is advised that you select Backup Material (on by default) when merging, as this will backup the current material in case you need to change anything later. Note that this backed up material will dissapear when restarting Blender, however up to 5 of the individual layers will also be stored in the Deleted Layers panel, if you need to access them that way. As per the image above, you can specify the resolution of the baked textures. This is 4k by default, but you may need to increase this if you have high resolution starting textures and/or you use a high scale value in the mapping. If the resolution is too low, you may lose detail/quality in the merged layer, so you can repeat the process with a higher resolution (assuming you have backed up the material). If you are using the displacement channel in any of your layers, you will also be asked whether you want to bake displacement to normals . This is off by default, but when switched on, converts any displacement to a normal map, and combines this with whatever other normals are present. As a final note, you will be prompted to open the system console prior to clicking ok . This will let you monitor the progress of the layer merging/baking. Otherwise, Blender will merely freeze until the algorithm is completed.","title":"Merge/Bake Visible"},{"location":"merge_visible.html#mergebake-visible","text":"The merge visible and bake visible tools, located in the main UI panel, automatically bake the visible material to a set of textures.

Multipass Layer With a multipass layer selected, you will first see the following interface: Here you can select which of these channels you want to include in the multipass setup for the layer. Any channels that are not selected here will have an opacity of 0 for the layer. In other words, they will be given the value of whatever is underneath the painted area on the mesh. Opening one of these subpanels reveals a checkbox, which is used to switch on the channel. For example, below shows the roughness panel opened: Ticking this checkbox reveals the channel-specific interface, which is used to control all of the properties of the channel for the layer. Again, the example below is for the roughness channel, but most channels are controlled using a similar interface: For the albedo channel, you can either paint the color directly or opt to paint a constant value by selecting constant albedo . This will apply a constant color over the painted area for the layer, which you can then adjust. For the metallic , roughness , normals , specular and displacement channels, you can select a single value that will be applied over the painted area. For the normal channel, you can also select the strength of the normals, while for the displacement channel, you can adjust the displacement scale and midlevel . You can also adjust the opacity of each of these layers individually. An opacity of 0 is identical to not including the channel at all, and an opacity of 1 is completely opaque. You can also opt to import a map/texture for each channel, using the use channel map checkbox. This will then let you add a texture to use for painting within that channel. For example, selecting roughness texture shows the following: Once a texture is loaded, you may (if applicable for the channel type) also have the option of a color ramp, to fine tune the texture output: If ambient occlusion (AO) is selected, you will immediately be prompted to select a texture for the channel. You can also change the AO strength here. AO is typically used with a corresponding albedo texture. If you use a normal map/texture, you will also see a new checkbox appear next to opacity , called Combine normals : If selected, combine normals will automatically combine the normals of the current layer with any normals underneath. The method used is mathematically-derived, so can be applied for multiple stacked layers to combine all normals accurately. Refer to the instructional video for a demonstration on painting with combined normals. Finally, for each of these channels you can also use a procedural texture , which procedurally generates the texture for the channel based on the settings used. For example, the GIFs below show a normal channel painted using two different types of procedural textures : a noise texture (top) and a voronoi texture (bottom): Noise texture: Voronoi texture: As for the normal texture option, you can also use combine normals for procedural textures . This means that you can combine procedural textures with other procedural textures , or even with imported textures! The possibilities are endless! Single Pass Layer A single pass layer lets you paint individual PBR channels one at a time, much like how Blender's internal texture painting system works. However, the main difference is that the single pass layer is embedded within PBR Painter, and therefore works within the layer-based system. Also, by default new images will have an alpha value of 0 everywhere, so that they don't cover up underlying layers. As you paint, only the painted areas will show on the texture. When you select a channel, you will be prompted to first select which cannel you wish to paint: Then, you will be prompted to create a new image (or open a previous image) in order to start painting: Once you have an image created/loaded, you can start painting a texture for that channel. You can use all of the tools you will be familiar with to do this, such as texture masks, stencils etc. When you are happy with a channel, you can switch to another and repeat these steps, until all channels have been painted. An important application of this, which is covered in the instructional video, is painting over seams, which can be obvious if painting textures onto a mesh with a multipass layer. Once you are happy with your imported maps and/or values for other PBR components, this panel can be closed to clean up the UI. Now, you are ready to check out the ID Map panel. ID Map As the name suggests, this panel is for importing and using an ID map for the material: If you are not familiar with ID maps, they are essentially color-coded maps representing different regions in the material. Using an ID map lets you paint only on a specific region at a given time. Once an ID map has been opened/imported, you will see the following options: Click View ID map on mesh to see the map on the mesh, then select the ID Color of the region you wish to work with, using the eyedropper tool: With the color selected, you can increase the color threshold value if there is an issue with the color matching, or if you want to include similar colors in your selection. Once the ID map is applied and the color selected, with the appropriate threshold, painting will be restricted to only that region, e.g.: The next panel to check out is the masks panel, where you can add a variety of different masks to use for the layer. Masks In this subpanel, you can add a alpha map , a geometric mask and/or procedural mask to the texture: In the example below, a 'logo' alpha map has been used to paint rock over the top of a dirt background: It is important to recognize that an alpha map can be any greyscale image, meaning that it is easy to make your own. If you select geometric mask , you will have the option of either a curvature mask or a normal direction mask: Note that other options will be added with future versions of PBR Painter. As for the ID map, you can visualize these masks on the mesh with the checkbox shown, and you can adjust them as needed using the colorramp properties and/or the normal direction interactive tool (for normal direction only): Note that any masks used will be combined/multiplied (and also multiplied with the ID map, if used). This gives fine control over different combinations of masks. Texture Mapping This panel allows you to change the mapping type (either UV or Box ), scale , location (in the x and y directions) and the rotation of any imported PBR texture maps: Note that if no maps are imported you will be prompted that this panel is not applicable. Play around with these values to get the mapping that works for you. For example, Box mapping is useful for blurring seams in the mesh, which can be achieved using the seam blend tool: If you have an alpha map loaded, you will also see the option to use separate mapping for the alpha map: This is useful if you don't want your alpha map to be mapped in the same way as your imported textures for the material. Other Principled BSDF Inputs Here you will find all of the other inputs to the Principled Shader, which can be modified as necessary. Note that you can also change the opacities of each input for the layer, as per the previous section: Note also that this subpanel is only available for a multipass layer. In many cases, these values can remain unchanged, however there are certain materials that will require them to be modified. Note that selecting any channel will trigger the Merge Visible function to bake that value as an individual map, as is explained later. Deleted Layers Finally, the last panel, the Deleted Layers lets you recover up to 3 deleted layers and return them to the active layers list. This is useful if you change your mind or accidentally delete a layer and wish to recover it at a later point. Alternatively, layers can be permanently deleted from this panel, at which point they can no longer be recovered.","title":"UI Subpanels"},{"location":"other_panels.html#ui-subpanels","text":"","title":"UI Subpanels"},{"location":"other_panels.html#pbr-channels","text":"This panel will contain different options, depending on whether the selected layer is a multipass or single pass layer.","title":"PBR Channels"},{"location":"other_panels.html#multipass-layer","text":"With a multipass layer selected, you will first see the following interface: Here you can select which of these channels you want to include in the multipass setup for the layer. Any channels that are not selected here will have an opacity of 0 for the layer. In other words, they will be given the value of whatever is underneath the painted area on the mesh. Opening one of these subpanels reveals a checkbox, which is used to switch on the channel. For example, below shows the roughness panel opened: Ticking this checkbox reveals the channel-specific interface, which is used to control all of the properties of the channel for the layer. Again, the example below is for the roughness channel, but most channels are controlled using a similar interface: For the albedo channel, you can either paint the color directly or opt to paint a constant value by selecting constant albedo . This will apply a constant color over the painted area for the layer, which you can then adjust. For the metallic , roughness , normals , specular and displacement channels, you can select a single value that will be applied over the painted area. For the normal channel, you can also select the strength of the normals, while for the displacement channel, you can adjust the displacement scale and midlevel . You can also adjust the opacity of each of these layers individually. An opacity of 0 is identical to not including the channel at all, and an opacity of 1 is completely opaque. You can also opt to import a map/texture for each channel, using the use channel map checkbox. This will then let you add a texture to use for painting within that channel. For example, selecting roughness texture shows the following: Once a texture is loaded, you may (if applicable for the channel type) also have the option of a color ramp, to fine tune the texture output: If ambient occlusion (AO) is selected, you will immediately be prompted to select a texture for the channel. You can also change the AO strength here. AO is typically used with a corresponding albedo texture. If you use a normal map/texture, you will also see a new checkbox appear next to opacity , called Combine normals : If selected, combine normals will automatically combine the normals of the current layer with any normals underneath. The method used is mathematically-derived, so can be applied for multiple stacked layers to combine all normals accurately. Refer to the instructional video for a demonstration on painting with combined normals. Finally, for each of these channels you can also use a procedural texture , which procedurally generates the texture for the channel based on the settings used. For example, the GIFs below show a normal channel painted using two different types of procedural textures : a noise texture (top) and a voronoi texture (bottom): Noise texture: Voronoi texture: As for the normal texture option, you can also use combine normals for procedural textures .
